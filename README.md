###### Inverse Design and Multi-objective Optimization for Glasses


The ion exchange process entails submerging glass, characterized by a modest concentration of alkali oxides (typically 10-20 mol% Li2O and/or Na2O), into a molten salt bath containing larger alkali cations (NaNO3 for glass with Li2O or KNO3 for glass with Na2O) at an approximate temperature of 400Â°C.

The animation presented below illustrates how the NSGA-II algorithm methodically searches for optimal values of DOL (Depth of layer) and CS (Compressive stress).
